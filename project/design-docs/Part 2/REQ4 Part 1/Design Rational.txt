FireFlower:
    it inherits from ConsumableItems, since it can be consumed by the player

Tree:
    the tree's children (sapling, sprout and mature) when they grow, they have a chance
    to spawn a fire flower, but because of DRY, I decided to make a function called
    "attemptSpawnAFireFlower" in the tree class that is called by the children, so they
    call it when growing making it so that they can spawn a fire flower, but they don't
    know about its existence only the tree class does

most of the requirement logic is in part 2, so the more interesting design decision are made there
